Multi-purpose framework for Python3 and Above

The framework which i use to make my projects simpler and faster by using the same code to process and test programs.
Main purpose of the framework is to make my code easier to read and write. Why did i use the name framework? because its similar to a framework to me and just plainly sounds cool.

You can use the framework for anything you want and contribute to the code to make it better.
Hope you have fun using this and thats it.
