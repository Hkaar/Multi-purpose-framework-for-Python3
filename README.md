Multi-purpose framework for Python3 and Above

The framework which i use to make my projects simpler and faster by using the same code to test my projects.
Main purpose of the framework is to make my code easier to read and write. You can use the framework for anything you want and contribute to the code to make it better.

Q:
What does DCMS stand for?
A:
DCMS originally stands for Data Creating Mnagement System, i named it that way because originally it was for managing and creating data duh. Why i didnt changed it because im too lazy to come up with a new name.
Q:
Why the name framework instead of something else?
A:
Because it just plainly cool to me.

Hope you have fun using this, and enjoy!
