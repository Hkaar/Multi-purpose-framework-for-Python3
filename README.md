Multi-purpose framework for Python3

DCMS framework is a python framework or a script that contains a bunch of functions 
to manipulate some of the types of default data sets in Python3. The framework/script 
is still in development and always be open-sourced. 

If you have any suggestions to add to the project please tell me on my github page,
and also report any bugs or problems that you encounter while using this project.

Changelogs:
-) Added functions to convert lists and dictionaries to a selected string format.
-) Improved default framework terminal, for making it more suitable for debugging
python scripts.
-) Improved some default framework terminal functions.
-) Added the 'framewrk -ls -cmd' function to list all commands within the command
dictionary.
-) Removed some functions that were in the last version, some of the functions are
'import_modules', 'import_dictionaries', 'convert_str', 'shutdown' due to performance, 
and not working as intended.
-) Changed the settings scheme within the framework/script.

Hope you have fun using this, and enjoy!
